# Week 3 — Electronics Fundamentals

## Day 1 — Electrical Basics & Ohm’s Law
Learned voltage, current, resistance, and power using intuition + simple calculations. Built a first LED + resistor circuit and calculated LED current with Ohm’s law.

## Day 2 — Breadboarding & LED Circuits
Practiced breadboard rails/rows and correct LED polarity (anode/cathode). Reinforced why the resistor is required to limit current and protect the LED.

## Day 3 — Buttons, Pull-Ups/Pull-Downs & Digital Signals
Learned what “floating” inputs are and how pull-up/pull-down resistors force a stable HIGH/LOW. Built a button-controlled LED circuit and explained what changes when the button is pressed.

## Day 4 — Analog Signals & Potentiometers
Learned what analog voltage means and how a potentiometer acts as a voltage divider. Connected the pot to A0 and interpreted how the analog reading changes when turning the knob.

## Day 5 — LED Dimmer Mini-Project (Arduino)
Built a potentiometer-controlled LED brightness circuit using PWM on pin 9 and analog input A0. Uploaded Arduino code that reads A0 and writes PWM output to the LED.

## Day 6 — Measurement & Debugging
Attempted multimeter voltage/current/continuity checks; continuity worked but voltage readout did not, so I used Arduino readings as a backup measurement method. Logged what worked, what failed, and what I’ll retest with a new multimeter.

## Day 7 — Weekly Review & Concept Check
Rebuilt the LED dimmer cleanly and confirmed the wiring + code flow end-to-end. Wrote this README and pushed Week 3 work to GitHub.
